# CAP AUTHENTICATION [![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/CAP-Active-<COLOR>.svg)](https://shields.io/)

**CAP AUTHENTICATION** is a module for **Angular**

* registration
* login
* profile
* change password

you can use one of the two largest authentication services on the market **Auth0** or **Firebase**

## **Previous requirements**
**CAP AUTHENTICATION** use bootstrap's classes. To be able to display the component in the right way, bootstrap should have been installed in the project. In case you don't have bootstrap installed, you can run the following command or read their [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/download/):
```
npm install bootstrap
```
One's that you installed bootstrap you have to configure the `angular.json` and write into `styles`
```
"styles": [
  "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
  "styles.scss"
]
```

We will also need **@angular/fire** to use the Firebase services, for this we must have previously created a project on this platform and enabled authentication methods such as **Email/passord**, **Facebook** and **Google**.
```
npm install firebase @angular/fire --save
```

We position ourselves in the **app.module.ts** of our project and configure **AngularFireModule** with the credentials we obtain from the Firebase platform. It will look as follows.


```
import { AngularFireModule } from '@angular/fire';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    AngularFireModule.initializeApp({
      apiKey: '<your-apiKey>'
      authDomain: '<your-authDomain>'
      databaseURL: '<your-databaseURL>'
      projectId: '<your-projectId>'
      storageBucket: '<your-storageBucket>'
      messagingSenderId: '<your-messagingSenderId>'
      appId: '<your-appId>'
      measurementId: '<your-measurementId>'
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule { }
```
